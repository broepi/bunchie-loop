This program plays the colored bunchie gif animation with the music track "Brazilian Flower" by
"Jean-Jacques Perrey" in the background. The whole thing is infinitely looped.

This program serves a higher purpose: If you feel stressed or under pressure, then start this
animation program and keep in mind, how stupid we humans are!

For me it works well.
