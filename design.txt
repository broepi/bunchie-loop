bunchie-loop
============

It plays the colored bunchie animated gif with the music title "Brazilian Flower" by
"Jean-Jacques Perrey" in the background. The whole thing is infinitely looped.

- bunchie animation available as animated gif "bunchie_color.gif" from [1]
- music shall be looped like in [2]
- music available via torrents
- written in python
- uses pygame for visualization und playback

Resources
=========

pygame documentation [3]

Pre Testings
============

1. Show a window with pygame, destroyed with "cross" or alt+f4 
	... done!
2. Show a still picture in the window (png format)
	... done!
3. Try to load gif animation with PIL (Python Imaging Library) [4] then save single frames as new.
	... failed! PIL sucks extracting gif frames!
4. Try playing music as ogg vorbis in background with pygame.mixer.music, and loop it.
	... done!
	but: quality seems to be truncated and not enough flexibilities to loop the music in several
	parts
5. Try playing music as ogg vorbis in background with pygame.mixer, and loop it.
	... done! works good. but quality still not the optimal

Putting it all together
=======================

animate single extracted frames as png from the gif. 60ms frame duration. play brazilian flower in
background

Further improvement
====================

* bunchie scaled to window size, but not stretched
* double buffered

* pre-create scaled bunchie frames
* set window label
